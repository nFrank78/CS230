1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was a company called The Gaming Room who had a successful game called Draw It or Lose It and needed guidance for the development of a web-based version of the game.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

What I did well in developing the documentation for their web-based game was going over extensively the requirements for this project and then listing the stengths and weaknesses for different platforms. I gave a thorough analysis of what I would reccomend for this project such as OS, storage, security, memory, etc. and making it into an easily comprehendable guide.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The fact that the design document was layed out in an organized fasion with a diagram that allowed for easy comparison between operating systems and requirements is what I found to be the most helpful. By having this organization and ease of reference I was better able to compare and contrast each and make my recomendations.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The part I would want to revise would be the evaluations portion in order to give a better and more comprehensive analysis of each. However, if i were to revise it then I would want to spend even more time educating myself in depth on subject material in order to give the absolute best evaluations I could. Altering the evaluations could effectively cause me to change my recomendations but I doubt it.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are the most important because if they aren't met in a satisfactory way then the user will likely stop using the software. In order to interpret the user's needs I thought about the software which is a game and thought about what the most important aspects of a web-based game are which I beleive is functionality and the speed or smoothness of operations. The UI is important and any graphics and displays should be clean and eye-pleasing but functionality is the most important. Games that are laggy or buggy are frustrating a deter users.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Breaking down the project into a list of functionalities and then analyzing each of those and their requirements allows for a better picture of the requirements and functionality of the project as a whole. I think this was the best way to approach the designing and helps nail down a more acurate estimation of the coding requirements and the system requirements and how it will all fit together.
